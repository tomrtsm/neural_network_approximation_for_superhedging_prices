# neural_network_approximation_for_superhedging_prices
Here we provide the code for the paper 'Neural network approximation for superhedging prices' by F. Biagini, L. Gonon, T. Reitsam. 
The paper can be found here: https://www.fm.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/download/publications/learning_superhedging_price.pdf

- lstm_bs_truncated_sigmoid.ipynb contains the code for the Black-Scholes model with the truncated sigmoid loss function.

- lstm_bs_relu.ipynb contains the code for the Black-Scholes model with the squared relu loss function. 

- lstm_trinomial_truncated_sigmoid.ipynb contains the code for the trinomial model with the truncated sigmoid loss function.

- lstm_trinomial_relu.ipynb contains the code for the trinomial model with the squared relu loss function.

We provide some weights which can be found in the folder weights.
